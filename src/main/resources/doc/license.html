The Artistic License<br>
Preamble<p>

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a Package may be copied, 
such that the Copyright Holder maintains some semblance of artistic control over the development 
of the package, while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute the Package 
in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to make reasonable modifications.<p>

Definitions:
<p>
"Package" refers to the collection of files distributed by the Copyright Holder, and derivatives 
of that collection of files created through textual modification. 
<p>
"Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been modified, or has been modified in 
accordance with the wishes of the Copyright Holder.
<p>
"Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright or copyrights for the package. 
<p>
"You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing this Package. 
<p>
"Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis of media cost, duplication 
charges, time of people involved, and so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the 
Copyright Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market that must bear the fee.) 
<p>
"Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item itself, though there may be fees 
involved in handling the item. It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under 
the same conditions they received it.
<p>
1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of the Standard Version of this 
Package without restriction, provided that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and 
associated disclaimers.
<p>
2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes and other modifications derived from the Public Domain 
or from the Copyright Holder. A Package modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard 
Version.
<p>
3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way, provided that you insert a prominent 
notice in each changed file stating how and when you changed that file, and provided that you do at 
least ONE of the following:
<p>
a) place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make them Freely Available, such as by 
posting said modifications to Usenet or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major 
archive site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include your modifications in 
the Standard Version of the Package.<br>

b) use the modified Package only within your corporation or organization.<br>

c) rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict with standard executables, which 
must also be provided, and provide a separate manual page for each non-standard executable that clearly 
documents how it differs from the Standard Version.<br>

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
<p>
4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or executable form, provided that you 
do at least ONE of the following:
<p>
a) distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library files, together with instructions (in 
the manual page or equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.<br>

b) accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of the Package with your modifications.<br>

c) accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding Standard Version executables, giving 
the non-standard executables non-standard names, and clearly documenting the differences in manual pages 
(or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get the Standard Version.<br>

d) make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.
<p>
5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of this Package. You may charge any fee 
you choose for support of this Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However, you 
may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly commercial) programs as part of a larger 
(possibly commercial) software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package as a product 
of your own.
<p>
6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as output from the programs of this 
Package do not automatically fall under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated 
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this Package.
<p>
7. C or Java subroutines supplied by you and linked into this Package shall not be considered part of 
this Package.
<p>
8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or promote products derived from this 
software without specific prior written permission.
<p>
9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT 
LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
